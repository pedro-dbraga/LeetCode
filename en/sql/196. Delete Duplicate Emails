196. Delete Duplicate Emails


In this exercise I didn’t know that delete could receive some clause that I learn to use in the Select statement, but I can use join in the delete statement.

The exercise Rule:

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one email with the smallest id.
Use a DELETE statement not a SELECT one.

The line of reasoning is to duplicate the table and compare with herself. The first table will be p and the second one will be dupli. If the table has the same email AND email p has a bigger id than the email dupli id, then i DELETE the row of this email.

DELETE p FROM Person p
INNER JOIN Person dupli
WHERE p.email = dupli.email AND  p.id > dupli.id
