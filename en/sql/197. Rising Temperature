197. Rising Temperature

Intuition
For each day it is necessary compare with the previous day and verify if the temperature is bigger then the previous day.
 
Select t1.id FROM Weather t1
    LEFT JOIN Weather t2
    WHERE DAY(t1.recordDate) > (DAY(t2.recordDate) - 1)
    AND t1.temperature > t2.temperature;


You have an error in your SQL syntax

Ok, first mistake: join without ON
Sometimes I forget that I need to build the table with a rule first, then put a WHERE clause if necessary.

Second mistake: DATEDIFF

I try to do fast and i din’t read the DATE mysql DATA types before doing this exercise.

There it is  explained.
DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) = condition


Select t1.id FROM Weather t1
    LEFT JOIN Weather t2
ON DATEDIFF(t1.recordDate, t2.recordDate) = 1
    WHERE  t1.temperature > t2.temperature;
